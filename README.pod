=head1 Compute expressions evaluating to a given rational number

The following expression 

	1+(2*3*((4*((5*6)+(7*8)))-9))

evaluates to 2011. Are there more such expressions yielding 2011, keeping the number of operations and the order of the numbers fixed - only varying the arrangement of the brackets and the operations to use in each place.

The program C<get2011> answers this kind of questions. Since for more than about 10 operations, quite a lot of computations have to be performed, the program allows multithreading.

There are two posts in my blog L<http://ruediger-plantiko.blogspot.com>, dating October 2011, discussing this program and its parts.
